<h2>ABOUT</h2>
<p>
  Welcome to my personal development space!
</p>
<p>
  This is <a href="https://github.com/inamona/ahi/">ahi</a>, an Angular client application built to help showcase several back-end development projects I've been working on in my spare time. I'll be periodically updating this site to incorporate new features, which you'll be able to access from the nav bar.
</p>
<p>
  Enjoy!
